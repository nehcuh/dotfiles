# Shell History Configuration
# This directory contains shell history files managed by stow
# 
# The actual history files (.bash_history, .zsh_history, etc.) are created
# automatically by the shell and should NOT be committed to git.
# 
# This directory structure allows for:
# - Consistent history file locations across systems
# - Proper .gitignore configuration to exclude sensitive history data
# - Stow management of history file locations and settings
#
# Files in this directory:
# - .bash_history (created automatically by bash)
# - .zsh_history (created automatically by zsh)
# - .histfile (alternative history file for some shells)
# 
# Git ignore patterns for these files are configured in the repository's .gitignore
