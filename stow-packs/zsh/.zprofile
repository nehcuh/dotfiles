# Zsh profile for login shells
# This file is sourced for login shells (both interactive and noninteractive)
#
# Note: Most configuration should be in .zshenv or .zshrc instead:
# - .zshenv: Environment variables (always sourced)
# - .zshrc: Interactive shell configuration (aliases, functions, prompts)
# - .zprofile: Login shell initialization (rarely needed)

# This file is intentionally left empty
# All essential configuration has been moved to .zshenv for broader compatibility
